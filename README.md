# pwgen-ws

This is my attempt to create a microservice un python. This microservice is very simple, and is a proof of concept for "how to use K8S / Prometheus" in a CI/CD context.
This WS is based on the instruction found here: https://medium.com/@ssola/building-microservices-with-python-part-i-5240a8dcc2fb

# Requirements
* A working K8S cluster (or minicube)
* A Drone-CI CI/CD setup
* A working Prometheus setup
* A oAuth2 external service
